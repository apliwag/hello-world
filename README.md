# hello-world
It is Spring 2022. I am currently in my second to last semester of my senior year.  I don't know how I'm gonna make it through this semester, but if I'm going to drown, then I'm gonna swim for my life at the very least.

In the beginning of the semester I was taking ECE 351 Signals and Systems II, MSE 304 Engineering Economy, ECE 425/L Microprocessors, ECE 561/L Digital Communications, & ECE 492 Senior Design with Professor Flynn's Angle of Arrival Group in the Optical Communicaitons Project & Professor Jackson's DSP Group in the Smart Antennas Project.

Signals and Systems was fine. I'm comfortable with the material and the Professor does a good job explaining the concepts and examples from the slides.

Engineering Economy was pretty neat. It was fun being exposed to these concepts from financing and investing. It felt like I was back to taking Physics for the first time again, surrounded by unfamiliar territory. Two weeks into the semeseter we found out that the teacher had to find a subsitute for his other online class session since he had some health problems, but it looks like we're okay. Okay about the start of the 4th week there was a notification that he had to find a substitution for our class session too, but I had already dropped the class by this time and was just watching students post on the discord server. This was actually a big choice to make-- choosing whether to drop ECE 561 or MSE 304 since at the end of the day it became a choice as to which electives I wanted to taken for the Spring and Fall.

Microprocessors and the corresponding lab are okay. I wasn't originally interested in the material and this class was just kept as a backup in case Digital Comms got cancelled. I don't love it, but I appreciate what it does. This is what I thought in the beginning of the semester, but I've grown to like it as I learn more about the subject.

Originally, I was only suppose to choose one lab based class this semester. ECE 425/L Microprocessors or ECE 561/L Digital Communications, 
but due to low enrollment in the ECE 561 lab from the beginning of the semester , there was constant worry every week whether both the class AND lecture component would get cancelled. Ultimately the lab did get cancelled after 3 weeks into the semester, but it no longer became a required co-requisite. The first three weeks have been mostly review, but I haven't really found time to review on my own.

Senior Design was a big source of contention in my mind. It was hard to make a decision, and even now I'm only 65% confident in my choice.
